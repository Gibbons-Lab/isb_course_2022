# QIIME

Pronounced like wind *chime*.

Created ~2010 during the Human Microbiome Project (2007 - 2016) under the leadership
of Greg Caporaso and Rob Knight.

---

## What is QIIME?

> QIIME 2 is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome
analysis package with a focus on data processing and analysis transparency.

*Q*uantitative *I*nsights *i*nto *M*icrobial *E*cology

---

## So what is it really?

Essentially, QIIME is a set of *commands* to transform microbiome *data* into
*intermediate outputs* and *visualizations*.

<img src="assets/barplot.gif" width="100%">

It's commonly used via the *command line*.

---

[QIIME 2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0209-9)
was introduced in 2016 and improves upon QIIME 1, based on user experiences during the HMP.

Major changes:

- integrated tracking of *data provenance*
- semantic *type system*
- extendable *plugin* system
- multiple *user interfaces* (in progress)


---

## Where to find help?

QIIME 2 comes with a lot of help, including a wide range of [tutorials](https://docs.qiime2.org/2021.8/tutorials/),
[general documentation](https://docs.qiime2.org/2021.8/) and a
[user forum](https://forum.qiime2.org/) where you can ask questions.

---

## Artifacts, actions and visualizations

QIIME 2 manages *artifacts*, which are basically intermediate data that feed
into *actions* to either produce other artifacts or *visualizations*.

<div class="footnote">

https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.8/tutorials/overview/

</div>

---

## Remember

Artifacts often represent *intermediate steps*, but Visualizations are *end points*
meant for human consumption :point_up:.

---

## What is amplicon sequencing?

<img src="assets/16S.png" width="100%">

---

## Why the 16S gene?

![](assets/16S_gene.png)


The 16S gene is *universal* and contains interspersed conserved regions perfect for *PCR* priming and hypervariable regions with *phylogenetic heterogeneity*.

---

We have our raw sequencing data, but QIIME 2 only operates on artifacts. How
do we convert our data into an artifact??

:hatched_chick: or :egg:?

<!-- .slide: data-background="var(--primary)" class="dark" -->

## Our first QIIME 2 commands

:computer: Let's switch to the notebook and get started

---

## Time to bring out the big guns :bomb::zap:

We will now run the DADA2 plugin, which will do 3 things:

1. filter and trim the reads
2. find the most likely original sequences in the sample (ASVs)
3. remove chimeras
4. count the abundances

---

## Preprocessing sequencing reads

1. trim low quality regions
2. remove reads with low average quality
3. remove reads with ambiguous bases (Ns)
4. remove PhiX (bacteriophage genome commonly added as a control to sequencing runs)

---

## Identifying alternative sequence variants (ASVs)

<img src="assets/dada2.png" width="80%">

Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm used to build a dataset-specific error model
and find true amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), all at once.

---

## PCR chimeras

<img src="assets/chimera.png" width="60%">

The primers used in this study were F515/R806. The numbers denote positions along the 16S gene. So, how long is the amplified fragment?

---

We now have a table containing the counts for each ASV in each sample.
We also have a list of ASVs.

<br>

:thinking_face: Do you have an idea for what we could do with these two data sets? What quantities
might we be interested in?

---

## Diversity metrics

In microbial community analysis we are usually interested in two different families of diversity metrics,
*alpha diversity* (ecological diversity within a sample) and *beta diversity* (ecological differences between samples).

---

## Alpha diversity

How diverse is a single sample?

<img src="assets/alpha_diversity.png" width="50%">

- *richness:* how many taxa do we observe (richness)?<br>
  → total number of observed taxa
- *evenness*: how evenly are abundances distributed across taxa?<br>
  → Evenness index
- *mixtures*: metrics that combine both richness and evenness<br>
  → Shannon index, Simpson's Index

---

## Statistical tests for alpha diversity

Alpha diversity will provide a single value/covariate for each sample.

It can be treated as any other sample measurement and is suitable for classic
univariate tests (t-test, Mann-Whitney U test).

---

## Beta diversity

How different are two or more samples/donors/sites from one another other?

<img src="assets/beta_diversity.png" width="50%">

- *unweighted:* how many taxa are *shared* between samples?<br>
  → Jaccard index, unweighted UniFrac
- *weighted:* do shared taxa have *similar abundances*?<br>
  → Bray-Curtis distance, weighted UniFrac

---

### UniFrac

Do samples share *genetically similar* taxa?

<img src="assets/unifrac.png" width="70%">

Weighted UniFrac further scales phylogenetic branch lengths by abundances.

---

## How to build a phylogenetic tree?

One of the basic things we might want to look at is how the ASVs across
all samples are evolutionarily related to one another. That is, we are often interested in their *phylogeny*.

Phylogenetic trees are built from *multiple sequence alignments* and sequences are
arranged by *sequence similarity* (branch length).

---

We can visualize this tree with [EMPRESS](https://github.com/biocore/empress).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocore/empress/master/docs/moving-pictures/img/empire_sample_selection_outlierpalm_plus_gut.gif" width="75%">

---

## Principal Coordinate Analysis

<img src="assets/pcoa.png" width="100%">


---

## Statistical tests for beta diversity

More complicated. Usually not normal and very heterogeneous. PERMANOVA can deal with that.

<img src="assets/permanova.png" width="80%">

## Run the diversity analyses

:computer: Let's switch to the notebook and calculate the diversity metrics

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="var(--primary)" class="dark" -->

## What organisms are present in our samples?

We are still just working with sequences and we have no idea what *organisms*
those sequences correspond to.

<br>

:thinking_face: What would you do to go from a sequence to an organism's name?

---

## Taxonomic ranks

<img src="assets/ranks.png" width="40%">

---

Even though directly aligning our sequences to a *database of known genes*
seems most intuitive, this does not always work well in practice. Why?

---

## Multinomial Naive Bayes

<img src="assets/naive_bayes.png" width="75%">

Instead, use *subsequences (k-mers)* and their counts to *predict* the
lineage/taxonomy with *machine learning* methods. For 16S amplicon fragments, this
approach often provides better *generalization* and faster results.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="var(--primary)" class="dark" -->

## Let's assign taxonomy to our samples

:computer: Let's switch to the notebook and assign taxonomy to our ASVs

---

## Your turn

Are certain *taxa* only found in one environment? Are others more widely distributed?

## The project challenge &#129440;

<img src="assets/challenge.png" width="70%">

[Submit your figure here.](https://isb-microbiome.slack.com/archives/C02GZ4L392T)

Note:

Welcome to the 2021 ISB Microbiome Project challenge. Create a figure submission in this channel for a chance to win an awesome ISB T-shirt. Our team will pick one winning submission for each geographical region.

Rules:
- one entry per participant
- figure content has to be created only using Qiime 2 and the EMP data set from the course
- 4 panels (sub-figures) maximum, a single figure/plot is perfectly okay
- must include text that provides the region you identify with and a caption for the figure

Regions:
Regions are from the [United Nations Geoscheme](http://united%20nations%20geoscheme/). You can use the map in the link with the following changes:

- North America is split into: North America, United States, and Canada
- Antarctica is included as a region
